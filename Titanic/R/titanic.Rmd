## The Problem Statement
Predict survivors on the Titanic based on the following nine input variables.  We are provided two datasets: (1) train.csv, containing 891 records and (2) test.csv, containing 418 records.  The two datasets are provided with the intent that models are formulated using the train dataset and model performance is evaluated on the test dataset.

## About the Data

Variable|Definition|Key
------- | ---------- | ---------
survival|Survival|0 = No, 1 = Yes
pclass|Ticket|class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
sex|Sex|
Age|Age in year|
sibsp|	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic|
parch|	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic|
ticket|Ticket number|
fare|Passenger fare|
cabin|Cabin number|
embarked|Port of Embarkation|C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton|

### Variable Notes

**pclass**: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

**age**: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

**sibsp**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

**parch**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

### Sample Records
#### Training Data

```{r trainsample, echo=FALSE}
# Load raw data
train <- read.csv("train.csv", header = TRUE);
edaTrain = train;
knitr::kable( head(train), format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```
#### Test Data

```{r testsample, echo=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(stringr);
library(assertthat);
library(dplyr);
library(leaps);
# Load raw data
test <- read.csv("test.csv", header = TRUE);

# Add a "Survived" variable to the test set to allow for combining data sets
test.survived <- data.frame(Survived = rep(NA, nrow(test)), test[,]);

# Combine data sets
data_combined <- rbind(train, test.survived);
#data_combined$survived <- as.factor(data_combined$survived)

knitr::kable( head(test), format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```
***
## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Missing Values
The first step is to find any and all missing data in the train and test sets.  

#### Train Dataset
```{r eda1}
# go through each variable and if it's an empty factor or numeric NA, sum each column
nlTrainNA = sapply( train, function(x) switch( class(x), factor = sum(x==""), sum( is.na(x) ) ) );
tTrainNA = t(nlTrainNA);                                 # transpose named list
dfTrainNA = data.frame( tTrainNA );                      # convert to dataframe
```
The train.csv dataset had 3 columns with missing values: Age, Cabin, and Embarked.  Age is likely to be an important predictor of survival and we have data for 80% of the training subjects so imputing the missing values is likely to be beneficial.  The source of embarkation may not have obvious predictive power, but given that we have data for over 99% of the training subjects, imputing the missing values could provide value.  The Cabin variable is missing from over 77% of the test subjects.  At first impression, this variable seems like an unlikely candidate to impute values since so much source data is missing.
```{r eda1table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable( dfTrainNA, format="markdown", longtable=TRUE);
```

#### Test Dataset
```{r eda2}
nlTestNA = sapply( test, function(x) switch( class(x), factor = sum(x==""), sum( is.na(x) ) ) );
tTestNA = t(nlTestNA);                                 # transpose named list
dfTestNA = data.frame( tTestNA );                      # convert to dataframe
```
The test.csv dataset also had 3 columns with missing values: Age, Fare, and Cabin.  Like the train dataset, the Cabin variable is sparse, with over 78% subjects missing values.  The Age variable is populated for over 79% of the train subjects, and likely has good predictive power so it will likely be beneficial to impute values for subjects missing Age.  The Fare variable is missing for a single subject.  While Fare may not be an obvious predictor for survival, the fact that the dataset is over 99% complete for this variable indicates that it is a good candidate for imputation.
```{r eda2table, echo=FALSE}
library( ggplot2 );
knitr::kable( dfTestNA, format="markdown", longtable=TRUE);
```

### Variable Features

#### PassengerId
PassengerId is a primary key for each row of data in the train and test sets.  This variable will not be included in any of the predictive models.

#### Survived
Survived is the class we're trying to predict.

#### Pclass
Passenger class is either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
```{r eda_pclass1}
ggplot(train, aes(x = factor(Pclass), fill = factor(Pclass))) +
  geom_bar( show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Pclass") +
  ylab("Total Count")
```

The Pclass variable shows that most passengers in the train set held a 3rd class ticket.  491 of the 891 passengers were 3rd class, more than 1st and 2nd class combined.  
```{r eda_pclass2}
ggplot(train, aes(x = factor(Pclass), fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, position="dodge") +
  xlab("Pclass") +
  ylab("Total Count") +
  labs(fill = "Survived")
```

If the Survived variable is plotted as a function of passenger class, it appears that Pclass will be a predictor for survivability.  A higher percentage of first class passengers survived than died, contrary to the overall trend, whereas a far higher percentage of 3rd class passengers died than survived.

#### Name
It may seem that the passenger name is a lot like the PassengerId in that each name acts as a sort of primary key into the data and using name as a model feature would not generalize well.  However, the name field could possibly provide value.  The first twenty names in the train dataset:
```{r eda_name}
head(as.character(train$Name),n=20);
```
Each name begins with a surname before a comma and a title.  If the passenger is a married woman, her maiden name appears in parentheses.  Some of the titles may help infer age (Master. and Miss.) and surnames could help determine extended family travelling together, even if they've purchased separate tickets and are not in the same cabin.  Additionally, the presence of diacritical marks in a name could indicate that the passenger is a non-English speaker who might have had difficulty understanding instructions or the gravity of the situation.

#### Sex
Sex is an unordered factor, male or female.
```{r eda_sex1}
ggplot(train, aes(x = factor(Sex), fill = factor(Sex))) +
  geom_bar( show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Sex") +
  ylab("Total Count")
```

The Sex variable shows that most passengers in the training set were male (nearly 2/3 male).  577 of the 891 passengers were male, or 65%.
```{r eda_sex2}
ggplot(train, aes(x = factor(Sex), fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, position="dodge") +
  xlab("Sex") +
  ylab("Total Count") +
  labs(fill = "Survived")
```
If the Survived variable is plotted as a function of Sex, it appears that Sex will be a strong predictor for survivability.  Of the 314 female passengers in the training set, 233, or 74% survived.  On the other hand, of the 577 male passengers, only 109 survived, or 19%.

#### Age
As noted, there are age values for 80% of the training subjects, missing for 177 passengers.  The distribution of ages is slightly skewed right, with a median of 28 years and a mean of 29.7 years.
```{r eda_age1}
ggplot(subset(train, !is.na(Age)), aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=4) +
  xlab("Age") +
  ylab("Total Count");
ggplot(subset(train,!is.na(Age)), aes(y=Age,x="")) + geom_boxplot();
```

Age as a predictor of survivability:
```{r eda_age2}
ggplot(subset(train,!is.na(Age)), aes(x = Age, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_density( position="stack") +
  xlab("Age") +
  ylab("Total Count") +
  labs(fill = "Survived")
```

If we plot the Survived value as a function of the Age density, we see that there is a higher likelihood of younger passengers surviving over older passengers.  Up until the mid-to-late teens, a training set passenger is more likely to survive than die, so age is likely to be a useful predictor for survivability.

#### SibSp
This variable is unique in that it is combination of number of siblings or "1" if the passenger had a spouse on board the ship.  In some cases, it is not clear what the SibSp variable is encoding when a "1" is found - is the passenger travelling with a sibling or a spouse?  A SibSp of 2 or more is indicative of siblings.  It will likely be beneficial to disambiguate this variable into separate 'Siblings' and 'Spouses' variables.
```{r eda_sibsp1}
ggplot(train, aes(x = SibSp )) +
   geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5) +
   xlab("Number of Siblings/Spouses") +
   ylab("Total Count")
```

Most passengers in the training set (68%) had neither a spouse or sibling on board.  23% of the training set passengers had a single sibling or spouse on board.  The remaining 9% of the passengers had two or more (presumably) siblings on board.
```{r eda_sibsp2}
ggplot(train, aes(x = SibSp, fill = factor(Survived))) +
   geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5, position="dodge") +
   xlab("Number of Siblings/Spouses") +
   ylab("Total Count") +
   labs(fill = "Survived")
```

Survivability does appear to trend with the number of siblings/spouses on board.  A passenger having no siblings or spouses is most likely to have died, whereas a passenger with one or two siblings/spouses has around a 50% likelihood of surviving.  The remaining cases of three to eight siblings are likely too few from which to draw inferences individually, so it might make sense to pool the SibSp values as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3> to avoid overfitting to specific training cases.  A close examination of the seven instances of the SibSp variable in which SibSp equals 8 reveals that all the subjects were from the same family and were in the same cabin.  Predicting that all families of size 8 will perish is unlikley to generalize well.

#### Parch
Similar to SibSp, this variable convolves two separate pieces of data: the number of parents and the number of children this passenger has on board.  In some cases, it is not clear what the Parch variable is encoding when a "1" is found - is the passenger travelling with a parent or a child?  This can be inferred if the Age variable is present for the passenger, but if the Age is missing, it will be ambiguous and may need further analysis.  Perhaps the passenger's title (Mr., Miss., Master) could help.  Like SibSp, it will likely be beneficial to disambiguate this variable into separate 'Parents' and 'Children' variables.
```{r eda_parch1}
ggplot(train, aes(x = Parch )) +
   geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5) +
   xlab("Number of Parents/Children") +
   ylab("Total Count")
```

Most passengers in the training set (76%) had neither a parent or child on board.  13% of the training set passengers had a single parent or child on board.  About 9% of the passengers in the training set (80) had two or more parents or children on board.  The remaining 2% of the passengers had either 3, 4, 5, or 6 (presumably) children on board.
```{r eda_parch2}
ggplot(train, aes(x = Parch, fill = factor(Survived))) +
   geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5, position="dodge") +
   xlab("Number of Parents/Children") +
   ylab("Total Count") +
   labs(fill = "Survived")
```

Survivability does appear to trend with the number of parents/children on board.  A passenger having no parents or children is most likely to have died, whereas a passenger with one or two parents/children has around a 50% likelihood of surviving.  The remaining cases of three to six children are likely too few from which to draw inferences individually, so it might make sense to group the Parch values as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3>= to avoid overfitting to specific training cases.  

#### Ticket
The entries in the Ticket column do not seem to be of a uniform format.  Some ticket entries are just numbers - ranging from 693-392096.  Other ticket entries have character prefixes like "C.A." or "SOTON/O2", followed by a (presumably) ticket number.  
```{r eda_ticket}
head(as.character(train$Ticket),n=20);
```
An inspection of the set of tickets shows that presumed families tend to share a single ticket number.  The first impression is that the ticket number seems an unlikely predictor for survivability and could lead to overfitting the training set.  However, the ticket number might help populate the missing Cabin information - and Cabin might be a good predictor for survivability.

#### Fare
The fare (price paid per ticket) ranges from 0 to 512.3292.  The units are unclear, but are likely in English pounds.  The distribution is skewed to the right, with a median of 14.4542 and a mean of 32.20421.  A log transform of the data may be necessary to normalize the distribution of fares.  However, first the fare for passenger must be determined.  It appears to be the case that individual ticket numbers are not assigned per passenger, but rather a single ticket number is given to the purchaser of an allotment of tickets.  That is, families travelling together seem to be under the same ticket with the same fare.  So, it may be necessary to get to create an "Amount Paid per Passenger" feature that takes into account the number of people for which a fare was purchased on a single ticket.  

```{r eda_fare1}
ggplot(train, aes(x = Fare)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=4) +
  xlab("Fare") +
  ylab("Total Count");
ggplot(train, aes(y=Fare,x="")) + geom_boxplot();
```

Fare could conceivably be an important factor in determining survivability.  Perhaps the higher paying passengers received the first opportunity to board lifeboats.  Or perhaps, those higher paying passengers were more initially unwilling to leave their more comfortable accomodations for the plebian conditions aboard a lifeboat.  Fare as a predictor of survivability:
```{r eda_fare2}
ggplot(train, aes(x = Fare, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_density( position="stack") +
  xlab("Fare") +
  ylab("Total Count") +
  labs(fill = "Survived")
```

#### Cabin
The Cabin feature could be another strong predictor for survivability.  Perhaps cabins located nearest the lifeboats afforded the best survivability.  But, the Cabin variable has many empty values.  The empty values could mean that the information was not captured or it could mean that not all passengers received cabins and stayed in other accomodations.  Being assigned a cabin could be a proxy for one's social status and wealth.  If so, the Pclass variable might be co-linear.
```{r eda_cabin1}
levels(train$Cabin);
```

The cabin name mostly adheres to the rule of a single letter A-F,G,T, followed by a number up to 3 digits.  There are cases where a passenger has multiple cabins, each separated by whitespace.  The beginning letter of each cabin could denote a deck or particular region of the ship - which could help with predicting survivability.  Alternatively, the number of the cabin could be more informative than the beginning letter.  Perhaps cabins "A19" and "B19" are located right next to one another, for instance.  
```{r eda_cabin2}
cabinLetter = ifelse(train$Cabin == "", NA, substr(train$Cabin,1,1));
cabinREs = gregexpr("\\d+",train$Cabin, perl=TRUE);
cnMatches = regmatches( train$Cabin, cabinREs);
cabinNumber = numeric(length(cnMatches));
for ( i in 1:length(cnMatches) ){
  cabinNumber[i] = mean( as.numeric( unlist( cnMatches[i] )));
}
edaTrain$CabinLetter <- as.factor(cabinLetter);
edaTrain$CabinNumber <- cabinNumber;
ggplot( edaTrain, aes(x=CabinNumber,y=Survived,color=Survived ) ) + 
  geom_point( shape=1,position=position_jitter(height=0.25)) +
  ggtitle("Survivability by Cabin Number") +
  xlab("Cabin Number") +
  ylab("Survived");
ggplot(subset(edaTrain, !is.na(cabinLetter)), aes(x = CabinLetter, fill = as.factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Survivability by Ticket Letter") +
  xlab("Cabin Letter") +
  ylab("Total Count") +
  labs(fill = "Survived");
```

When grouping the passengers by cabin number, there does not appear to be a relationship where survivability depends on cabin number.  If so, there should be identifiable pockets of clusters where there is a higher incidence of survivability.  If such clusters appeared to exist, the clusters could be defined and the group of clusters tested with a Chi-Square test to measure if survivability depends on cabin cluster.

It's not immediately obvious if there is a benefit to categorizing the cabins according to their first letter.  Are these groups statistically different from one another?  A Chi-Square test of independence should show if survivability is dependent on cabin letter or not.
```{r eda_cabin3}
tbl = table( edaTrain$Survived, edaTrain$CabinLetter);
tbl
chisq.test(tbl);
```

The p-value is 0.17 so at a confidence level of 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that survivability is independent of the starting cabin letter.
```{r eda_cabin4}
edaTrain$CabinAssignment[ edaTrain$Cabin != "" ] <- "Assigned";
edaTrain$CabinAssignment[ edaTrain$Cabin == "" ] <- "Unassigned";
data_combined$CabinAssignment[ data_combined$Cabin != "" ] <- "Assigned";
data_combined$CabinAssignment[ data_combined$Cabin == "" ] <- "Unassigned";
ggplot(edaTrain, aes(x=CabinAssignment, fill=factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar() + 
  facet_wrap(~Pclass) + 
  ggtitle("Pclass") + 
  xlab("Cabin Assignment") +
  ylab("Total Count") +
  labs(fill="Survived");
```

From the graph, it appears that for each passenger class, if a passenger is assigned a cabin, their chances of surviving the disaster are better than if they had not been assigned a cabin.

#### Embarked

Passengers boarded the Titanic from one of three ports: (S)outhampton, England; (C)herbourg, France, or (Q)ueenstown, Ireland.  As noted, two passengers in the training set have no record of port of Embarkation.
```{r eda_embarked1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable( train[train$Embarked == "",], format="markdown", longtable=TRUE);
```

The two passengers are both female and in first class.
```{r eda_embarked2}
ggplot( edaTrain, aes(x=factor(Pclass),fill=factor(Survived)))+
  geom_bar() + 
  facet_wrap(~Embarked) +
  ggtitle("Survivability by Port of Embarkation and Passenger Class") +
  xlab("Passenger Class") +
  ylab("Count") +
  labs(fill="Survived");
```

### Errors in the Data

Errors in the input dataset are often not apparent until deeper analyses are performed, such as feature engineering and imputing missing data.  However, once the data is corrected, it is necessary to regenerate the columns and feature analyses that will feed the predictive models.  In this dataset, it was found that a 16-year-old member of a family was incorrectly identified as being the father:
```{r errors1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable( data_combined[ data_combined$Ticket == "W./C. 6608", ], format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```
In the Ford family, Mr. William Neal Ford has the value '1' for SibSp and '3' for Parch.  The value of '1' for SibSp would imply that William has either one spouse or one sibling.  In addition, William has a value of '3' for Parch.  This indicates that William has either 3 children, 1 parent and 2 children, 2 parents and 1 child, or 3 parents, which is clearly not possible according to the variable definition.  Since two of the children in the family, Miss. Doolina Margaret Ford (21), and Mr. Edward Watson Ford (18) are actually *older* than William, it is clear that he cannot be their father.  The other child, Miss. Robina Maggie Ford (9) is only 7 years younger than William, also indicating that William cannot be her father.  The matriarch of the family is Mrs. Edward Ford - not Mrs. William Neal Ford, which indicates that it's likely not a simple case of getting William Neal Ford's age wrong (for instance, 46 instead of 16).

Therefore, the best fix would be to change the Parch variables for Miss. Robina Maggie Ford, Miss. Doolina Margaret Ford, and Mr. Edward Watson Ford from '2' to '1' (due to the inclusion of Mr. William Neal as a brother).  In addition, the Parch variable of Mrs. Edward Ford would rise from '3' to '4', indicating she's travelling with four of her children and the Parch variable of Mr. William Neal Ford would change from '3' to '1' indicating that he's travelling with a single parent, his mother.  The SibSp variables would change from '2' to '3' for Miss. Robina Maggie Ford, Miss. Doolina Margaret Ford, and Mr. Edward Watson Ford, indicating that each of them are travelling with 3 siblings.  Similarly, Mr. William Neal Ford's SibSp variable would change from '1' to '3'.  Finally, Mrs. Edward Ford's SibSp would change from '1' to '0', indicating she was travelling without her husband (Mr. Edward Ford).  The changes appear below.
```{r errors2, echo=FALSE}
# Mr. William Neal Ford
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId ==  87,"SibSp"] = 3;  # From 1
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId ==  87,"Parch"] = 1;  # From 3
# Miss. Robina Maggie Ford
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 148,"SibSp"] = 3;  # From 2
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 148,"Parch"] = 1;  # From 2
# Miss. Doolina Margaret Ford
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 437,"SibSp"] = 3;  # From 2
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 437,"Parch"] = 1;  # From 2
# Mrs. Edward Ford
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 737,"SibSp"] = 1;  # From 1; Note: sister is Mrs. Eliza Johnston
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 737,"Parch"] = 4;  # From 3
# Mr. Edward Watson Ford
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 1059,"SibSp"] = 3;  # From 2
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 1059,"Parch"] = 1;  # From 2
knitr::kable( data_combined[ data_combined$Ticket == "W./C. 6608", ], format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```

Additionally, there are problems with the Abbott family with ticket C.A., 2673:
```{r errors3, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable( data_combined[ data_combined$Ticket == "C.A. 2673", ], format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```

Thirteen year old Master. Eugene Joseph Abbott has a Parch value of '2', meaning he has two parents on board.  A female on the same ticket, Mrs. Stanton Abbott, is 22 years older than Eugene at 35 years of age.  Mrs. Stanton Abbott has a SibSp of '1' and a Parch of '1'.  The other person on the ticket is 16-year-old Mr. Rossmore Edward Abbott, with a SibSp of '1' and a Parch of '1'.  It appears that 16-year-old Mr. Rossmore Edward Abbott was incorrectly designated the spouse of Mrs. Stanton Abbott instead of her son.  The corrections appear below.
```{r errors4, echo=FALSE}
# Master. Eugene Joseph Abbott
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 1284,"SibSp"] = 1;  # From 0
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 1284,"Parch"] = 1;  # From 2
# Mrs. Stanton (Rosa Hunt)
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 280,"SibSp"] = 0;  # From 1
data_combined[ data_combined$PassengerId == 280,"Parch"] = 2;  # From 1
knitr::kable( data_combined[ data_combined$Ticket == "C.A. 2673", ], format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```

## Feature Engineering
When importing into R, factor/class variables solely composed of numeric entries are interpreted and imported as numeric types, implying an ordering and a distance between entries.  These variables include PassengerId, Survived, and Pclass.  PassengerId is like a primary key for each passenger, so it's not necessary to convert this variable into a factor.  However, the Survived data is encoded as a binary flag where 1=survived and 0=not survived.  Since our goal is to predict classes (i.e., survived or died), it is necessary to convert this value into a factor.  The Pclass variable is a factor, but it is an ordered factor.  An ordered factor indicates that there is an ordering between the classes (1st class, 2nd class, 3rd class), but no magnitude between each class level can be inferred.
```{r feature1}
train$Survived = as.factor(train$Survived);
train$Pclass = as.ordered(train$Pclass);
```

### Imputing Missing Data

#### Embarked
Two passengers had no information for their port of embarcation, Miss. Amelie Icard and Mrs. George Nelson Stone.  These first class passengers were both on the same ticket (113572) and stayed in Cabin B28.  The majority of passengers boarded at Southampton (70%), as compared to Cherbourg (21%) and Queenstown (9%).  There is quite a variety in the ticket numbers on the Titanic.  Their ticket number, 113572, is one in a series of similar ticket numbers, all in the 113XXX format.  There are 56 tickets in the 113XXX format and of the 54 that have a valid port of embarcation, 81% were from Southampton.  Considering the different data points, the two missing Embarked values will be considered 'S' for Southampton.
```{r impute_embarked}
data_combined[62,"Embarked"] = as.factor("S");
data_combined[830,"Embarked"] = as.factor("S");
```

#### Cabin
As determined in the EDA section, over 77% of the passengers have no recorded cabin information.  In addition, the assigned cabins did not seem to have a predictable pattern from the available data.  Further, cursory analyses did not indicate that cabin assignments were a good predictor of survivability.  As such, the missing cabin data will not be imputed.

#### Fare
Out of 1309 records, one fare is missing:
```{r impute_fare1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable( data_combined[1044,], format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```

The fare can be estimated by considering the variables that most likely affect the Fare variable, such as passenger class (Pclass), port of Embarcation (Embarked), Cabin, and how many other people are on the same ticket.  The passenger class and port of embarkation are readily available in each data row.  The Cabin variable, however, is not useful in this case since the Cabin variable is not defined for passenger 1044.  However, the fact that no Cabin was recorded for this passenger is significant since perhaps not all passengers were assigned cabins (i.e., wealthy passengers would be assigned cabins, and hence pay higher fares, while less privileged passengers may have to had large, unassigned community accomodations with a comparatively lower fare).  

```{r impute_fare2}
ticketChar = as.character( data_combined$Ticket );
numPassengers = nrow( data_combined );
data_combined$NumPassengersOnTicket = 1;
for (i in 1:numPassengers ){
    thisTicket = as.character( data_combined[i,"Ticket"] );
    idxPeople = which( thisTicket == ticketChar );
    numPeople = length( idxPeople );
    data_combined$NumPassengersOnTicket[i] = numPeople;
}
# now constrain to those that have just 1 person on the ticket, as passenger 1044
singlePassengers = data_combined$NumPassengersOnTicket == 1;
embarkedS = data_combined$Embarked == 'S';
unassignedCabins = data_combined$CabinAssignment == 'Unassigned';
pClass3 = data_combined$Pclass == 3;
similarPassengers = which( singlePassengers & embarkedS & unassignedCabins & pClass3 );
similarPassengersFareData = data_combined[similarPassengers,];  # include all columns but the one we have no Fare info
similarPassengersFareData = similarPassengersFareData[ similarPassengersFareData$PassengerId != 1044,];  # include all columns but the one we have no Fare info
medianFare = median( similarPassengersFareData$Fare );
data_combined[1044,"Fare"] = medianFare;
hist(similarPassengersFareData$Fare, xlab = "Fare", ylab = "Passengers", main = "Fare of Similar Passengers");
summary( similarPassengersFareData$Fare );
```

There are 318 passengers that share the same characteristics as passenger 1044: passenger class 3, port of embarkation Southampton, cabin assignment (unassigned), and the number of people with the same ticket (1).  Excluding a fare of 3.1708 and two at 19.9667, the remaining fares are between 6.2375 and 10.5167.  Passenger 1044 is assigned the median fare of 7.896.

#### Age
As found above, the Age data is missing for 177 of the train set cases and 86 of the test set cases.  Since Age is likely to be an important predictor of survival, the missing data should be imputed.  As will be shown in the next section on Feature Engineering, the passenger's title can be extracted from their name.  The title should allow for a better estimate of a passenger's age.

The missing passengers have the following titles:
```{r impute_age1, echo=FALSE}
data_combined$FixedAge = data_combined$Age;
passenger_names = as.character(data_combined$Name);
num_commas = unname(sapply( passenger_names, str_count, ","));
all_commas = assert_that( all( num_commas == 1 ) );  # Make sure each row has a comma
# Now, extract titles.  Split on comma and take the tail end of the character string
surnames = sapply( strsplit(as.character(passenger_names), ","), head, 1);
data_combined$Surname = as.factor( surnames );
given_name_string = sapply( strsplit(as.character(passenger_names), ","), tail, 1);
given_name_string = trimws( given_name_string, "left"); # remove leading whitespace
data_combined$NameString = paste( given_name_string, surnames );
# Remove leading whitespace, if any
given_name_string = trimws( given_name_string, "left");
# To extract the title from the Name character string, split each string 
name_tokens = strsplit( given_name_string, "\\s+");
# Exract first token as the title
titles = lapply(name_tokens,"[[",1);
given_names = lapply(name_tokens,"[[",2);
data_combined$GivenName = as.factor( unlist( given_names ) );
title_regs = regexpr( "[\\w+]+\\.", given_name_string, perl=TRUE );
re_titles = regmatches( given_name_string, title_regs );
data_combined$Title = as.factor( unlist( re_titles ));
# The set of titles that have missing age values
ageNA = is.na( data_combined$Age );
titleNA = data_combined$Title[ageNA];
# The set of titles that have missing age values
data_combined$FixedTitle = data_combined$Title;
data_combined$AgeTitle = data_combined$Title;
data_combined$AgeTitle[ which( data_combined$Title == "Ms." & ageNA )] = as.factor( "Mrs." );
age_lm = lm( Age~AgeTitle, data=data_combined);
missingAgeIndices = which( is.na( data_combined$Age ) );
missingTitles = data_combined[missingAgeIndices,"AgeTitle"];
missingCount = table( missingTitles );
summary( missingTitles )
```

The resultant linear model uses the following average ages for each missing passenger title:
```{r impute_age2}
# model is simple: use the passenger's title (i.e., Mr., Master., Mrs.) to determine age
# May want to better this by using age of parents (if travelling with parents), age of siblings, spouse, etc.
age_lm = lm( Age~AgeTitle, data=data_combined);

missingAges = predict( age_lm, data_combined[missingAgeIndices,]);
data_combined[missingAgeIndices,"FixedAge"] = missingAges;
coeffs = coefficients( age_lm );
coeffNames = names(coeffs);
coeffValues = unname(coeffs);
# find (Intercept)
idxIntercept = match( "(Intercept)", coeffNames );
interceptValue = coeffValues[idxIntercept];
allOtherCoeffIndices = setdiff(1:length(coeffNames),idxIntercept);
allOtherCoeffValues = coeffValues[allOtherCoeffIndices];
titleAges = interceptValue + allOtherCoeffValues;
names(titleAges) =  gsub( "AgeTitle", "", coeffNames[allOtherCoeffIndices] );
knitr::kable( bind_rows(titleAges), format="markdown", longtable=TRUE)
```
***
### New Features

#### Title and AgeTitle
The Name variable in the test and train datasets has some structure - surname followed by a comma, then a title and a given name.  Additionally, a maiden name will be present in parentheses if the passenger is a married woman.
```{r feature2}
passenger_names = as.character(data_combined$Name);
head(passenger_names);
```
The implied structure is [SURNAME] COMMA [TITLE] [GIVEN NAME] (MAIDEN NAME if applicable).  Since the goal is to extract the title information from each row programmatically, it is  necessary to enforce some error checking - namely, that each row contain one and only one comma.  If this condition does not hold true, the title extraction task will be more tedious.

```{r feature3}
num_commas = unname(sapply( passenger_names, str_count, ","));
all_commas = assert_that( all( num_commas == 1 ) );  # Make sure each row has a comma
# Now, extract titles.  Split on comma and take the tail end of the character string
surnames = sapply( strsplit(as.character(passenger_names), ","), head, 1);
data_combined$Surname = as.factor( surnames );
given_name_string = sapply( strsplit(as.character(passenger_names), ","), tail, 1);
# Remove leading whitespace, if any
given_name_string = trimws( given_name_string, "left");
# To extract the title from the Name character string, split each string 
name_tokens = strsplit( given_name_string, "\\s+");
# Exract first token as the title
titles = lapply(name_tokens,"[[",1);
given_names = lapply(name_tokens,"[[",2);
data_combined$GivenName = as.factor( unlist( given_names ) );
```

The full set of extracted titles:
```{r feature4}
summary( data_combined$Title );
```

Most of these look correct and reasonable as titles ("Don." and "Dona." are Italian honorifics, as is "Jonkheer." a Dutch honorific).  However, the title "the" is suspicious.  The complete row is as follows:
```{r feature5}
data_combined[ which( data_combined$Title == "the" ), ]
```

Although it makes little difference in this case since there is only a single "the Countess. of Rothes" on board, the title of this passenger should be changed from "the" to "Countess.".  This could be fixed by changing the single record, but the fact that this incorrect title occurred in the first place indicates that the methodology for finding titles isn't robust enough.  Since it appears that the only time a "." appears in the Name field is at the end of a title, that information could be used to find all titles.
```{r feature6}
title_regs = regexpr( "[\\w+]+\\.", given_name_string, perl=TRUE );
re_titles = regmatches( given_name_string, title_regs );
data_combined$Title = as.factor( unlist( re_titles ));
summary( data_combined$Title );
```

Of particular interest are the titles that are underrepresented and how they might relate to the most abundant titles (Mr., Mrs., Miss., and Master.).  For instance, the title "Ms." has only two occurences and as such, has limited predictive power.  "Ms." generally refers to an adult woman, either married or unmarried and so is much closer to either a "Mrs." or "Miss." title than a "Mr.", for instance.  Additionally, the French designations for "Miss." and "Mrs." appear as Madamoiselle ("Mlle.") and Madame ("Mme.").  These titles would likely provide better predictive power if they were switched to their English equivalents.

Additionally, many of the Age attributes are missing from the dataset and since it seems likely that Age would be a strong predictor of survivability.  Title should be a fairly robust predictor for Age, so engineering a title feature that is reflective of Age could be beneficial (i.e., a Doctor with a missing Age value is much more likely to be an adult than a child and adults have a generally lower survival rate than children).  The titles of the passengers missing Age information are as follows:
```{r feature7}
# The set of titles that have missing age values
ageNA = is.na( data_combined$Age );
titleNA = data_combined$Title[ageNA];
summary( titleNA );
```

For the purposes of estimating the Age variable for this group, the "Ms." entry is better suited as a "Mrs.".  Although the "Dr." title has a relatively small number of instances, it is likely enough from which to draw a reasonable age estimate.
```{r feature8}
# The set of titles that have missing age values
data_combined$AgeTitle = data_combined$Title;
data_combined$AgeTitle[ which( data_combined$Title == "Ms." & ageNA )] = as.factor( "Mrs." );
summary( data_combined$AgeTitle );
```

#### Parents and Children
Next, the Parch variable encodes two different measures: the number of parents a passenger has on board AND/OR the number of children a passenger has on board.  Since this variable is overloaded, a more informative variable set might disambiguate these measures into NumParents and NumChildren (aboard).  Such a set of variables may provide more predictive power than the single Parch variable.
```{r feature9}
numParents = integer( nrow( data_combined ) );
numChildren = integer( nrow( data_combined ) );

MAX_CHILD_AGE = 14;

# Find all Parch > 0
posParch = data_combined$Parch > 0;
idxParch = which( posParch );
counter = 0;
numCases = length( idxParch );
for (thisRow in idxParch){

  counter = counter + 1;
  numParch = data_combined[thisRow,"Parch"];
  thisSurname = data_combined[thisRow,"Surname"];
  thisTicket = data_combined[thisRow,"Ticket"];
  thisTitle = as.character( data_combined[thisRow,"Title"] );
  thisAge = data_combined[thisRow,"Age"];
  if ( (thisTitle == "Master.") || (thisTitle == "Miss.") ){
    # if this passenger is a "Master." or Miss. and numParch <= 2, he/she must be someone's child
    numParents[thisRow] = numParch;
    #next;
  }
  if (!is.na( thisAge ) && thisAge <= MAX_CHILD_AGE ){

  ticketTitles = as.character( data_combined[ sameSurnameSameTicket, "Title"] );
  ticketParches = data_combined[ sameSurnameSameTicket, "Parch"];
  # now, look for passengers with the same surname on the ticket and check their titles and ages
  numSame = length( sameSurnameSameTicket );
  ages = sort( data_combined[sameSurnameSameTicket,"Age"] );
  thisAgePos = which( thisAge == ages )[1];  # find index of thisAge in sorted ages

  if ( numGenerationalGaps == 0 ){
    if ( !is.na( thisAge )){
      if ( ( thisAge >= 40 ) || (thisTitle == "Mrs." ) ){
        numChildren[thisRow] = numParch;
      }
      else if (numParch > 2 ){
        numChildren[thisRow] = numParch;
      }
      else{
        numParents[thisRow] = numParch;
      }
    }
    else{
      # no age information. If travelling with "kids", and title isn't a kid, then parent
      if ( ! ( thisTitle %in% c("Master.","Miss.") ) ){
        if( any( c("Master.","Miss.") %in% ticketTitles ) ){
          # now, if there are two Mr. in this group, we need to choose the real father
          # If there are three or more children, then Parch will be greater than 2 and
          # will indicate this is the father.  Else, it will be a child
          if( thisTitle == "Mr."){
            maxParches = max( ticketParches );
            if ( ( maxParches > 2 ) && ( maxParches == numParch ) ){

          }
        }
        else{
          # all we have is a non Mr. or Miss. title.  Make them a child
            numChildren[thisRow] = numParch;
        }
      }
      else{
        numParents[thisRow] = numParch;
      }
    }
  }
  else{
    if ( !is.na(thisAge) ){  # use age in comparison to generation gap to classify kids/parents
      maxGapPos = which.max( gaps ) + 0.5;  # the 0.5 puts it in the middle of the kids/parents
      if ( thisAgePos < maxGapPos ){

  }
  data_combined$NumParents = numParents;
  data_combined$NumChildren = numChildren;
}
```

#### Siblings and Spouses
Similar to Parch, the SibSp variable indicates the number of Siblings AND/OR Spouses a passenger has on board.  A better set of variables would be separate variables for Siblings and Spouses as it would be possible to model the original SibSp vector as a simple combination of the separate columns.
```{r feature10}
numSiblings = integer( nrow( data_combined ) );
numSpouses = integer( nrow( data_combined ) );

MAX_CHILD_AGE = 14;

posSibSp = data_combined$SibSp > 0;
idxSibSp = which( posSibSp );
counter = 0;
numCases = length( idxSibSp );
for (thisRow in idxSibSp){
  counter = counter + 1;
  numSibSp = data_combined[thisRow,"SibSp"];
  numParch = data_combined[thisRow,"Parch"];
  thisSurname = data_combined[thisRow,"Surname"];
  thisTicket = data_combined[thisRow,"Ticket"];
  thisTitle = as.character( data_combined[thisRow,"Title"] );
  thisAge = data_combined[thisRow,"Age"];
  thisSex = as.character( data_combined[thisRow,"Sex"] );
  thisGivenName = as.character( data_combined[thisRow,"GivenName"] );
  thisPassengerId = data_combined[thisRow,"PassengerId"];

    # if this passenger is a "Master." or Miss., this passenger is not married, so must be spouse
    numSiblings[thisRow] = numSibSp;
    next;
  }
  if (!is.na( thisAge ) && thisAge <= 10 ){
    # if this passenger is young, declare they cannot be parents, must be a child

  # get given names on same ticket
  same_ticket_rows = data_combined[which(sameSurnameSameTicket),];
  given_names = as.character( same_ticket_rows$GivenName );
  titles = as.character( same_ticket_rows$Title );
  sexes = as.character( same_ticket_rows$Sex );
  passengerIds = same_ticket_rows$PassengerId;
  master_mask = ( titles != "Master." );  
  sex_mask = ( sexes != thisSex );  # opposite sex marriage
  miss_mask = ( titles != "Miss." );
  this_mask = ( passengerIds != thisPassengerId );
  idxMatch = which( ( thisGivenName == given_names ) & master_mask & sex_mask & miss_mask & this_mask);
  if ( length( idxMatch ) == 1 ){
    numSpouses[thisRow] = 1;
    next;
  }
  ticketTitles = as.character( data_combined[ sameSurnameSameTicket, "Title"] );

#### FarePerPassenger
As determined in the EDA section, the Fare variable is not per passenger, it is the price paid for the ticket the passenger is traveling under (and multiple passengers may travel on the same ticket).  
```{r feature11}
ticketChar = as.character( data_combined$Ticket );
uniqueTickets = unique( ticketChar );
farePerPassenger = data_combined$Fare;
for (i in 1:length(uniqueTickets) ){
    thisTicket = uniqueTickets[i];
    idxPeople = which( ticketChar == thisTicket );
    theseFares = data_combined[idxPeople,"Fare"];
    #if ( !all( theseFares == theseFares[1] ) ){
    #    cat( thisTicket )
    #}
    # should only be a single fare
    
    numPeople = length( idxPeople );
    farePerPassenger[idxPeople] = theseFares[1]/numPeople;
}
data_combined$FarePerPassenger = farePerPassenger;
```

***
## Models
This is a classification problem with two classes: { Died, Survived }.  This is encoded in the 'Survived' variable in the train dataset. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

<!-- Globals -->
<!-- Data set -->

```{r include = FALSE}
MAX_HOURS = 10;
library( assertthat );
data_combined$pclass <- as.factor(data_combined$Pclass);

# A bit about R data types (e.g., factors)
summary(data_combined );

```

### Null Model
```{r null1, echo=FALSE}
numPassengers = length(train$Survived);
died = sum( train$Survived == 0);
survived = sum( train$Survived == 1);
#assert_that( died + survived == numPassengers);
mean_survived = survived/numPassengers;
cat( "Of ", numPassengers, " passengers, ", died, " died and ", survived, " survived.\nMean Survivability = ", survived/numPassengers );
```
The simplest model would be to assume that all test subjects are members of the most common class in the train dataset.  In the train dataset, 62% of the subjects died, so this simple model would assume that all the test passengers die.  This would yield a prediction accuracy of about 62%, and a corresponding misclassification rate of 38%, all false negatives.

This simple model is also the fastest to implement and serves as a good initial benchmark from which to improve upon.

Upon submission to the Kaggle site, the model yielded a score of 0.62679.  In terms of the bias/variance tradeoff, this is a very biased model (very inflexible) and the variance will likely be very small (i.e., the choice of training set will not affect predictions on the test set except in rare cases where more survivors are selected than non-survivors).

```{r null2, echo=FALSE}
# Time strip
nullModel = data.frame(PassengerId=test$PassengerId, Survived=0);
write.csv( nullModel, "titanicNullModel.csv", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE );

hours = 1;
par(mfrow=c(2,1));
barplot( hours, width=0.9, main="Time", xlab="hours", ylim=c(0,1), xlim=c(0,MAX_HOURS), horiz=TRUE );
#bp = ggplot(data=hours,aes(x=hours,y=1)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_flip();
#bp
### Bias-Variance Strip

```

### Gender Submission Model
Along with the train.csv and test.csv file, Kaggle provides an additional file called 'gender_submission.csv'.  This file is a sample submission to Kaggle in which all the female passengers are predicted to survive while all of the male passengers are predicted to die.


```{r genderSubmissionModel, echo=FALSE}
femaleIndices = which( train$Sex == 'female' );
maleIndices = which( train$Sex == 'male' );
numFemales = length( femaleIndices );
numMales = length( maleIndices );
proportionFemaleSurvival = length( intersect( femaleIndices, which( train$Survived == 1)))/numFemales;
proportionMaleSurvival = length( intersect( maleIndices, which( train$Survived == 0)))/numMales;
```

In the training set, of the 891 passengers, 342 are female.  233 of the 342 female passengers in the training set survived (74.2%).  Of the 549 male passengers in the train set, 468 did not survive (81.1%).  This yields an overall classification rate of 78.7% for the test set.  On the bias/variance continuum, this model is very biased and should have small variance.

Upon submission to Kaggle, this model scored 0.76555.

### Women and Children First Model
The canonical model for a sinking ship is that women and children get preferential access to lifeboats while men are expected to defer.  If 100% accordance to this model is assumed and all women and children are boarded onto lifeboats while the men are left to fight it out for flotsam in the frigid waters, women and children would be expected to survive while the men would perish.

Since the Age variable is missing for 177 of the train set cases and 86 test set cases, the imputed Age values from above will be used.  For this application, a child will be defined as a person under 15 years of age.
```{r womenAndChildrenFirstTrain, echo=FALSE}
femaleIndices = which( train$Sex == 'female' );
newTrain = subset( data_combined, PassengerId <= nrow(train) );
newTest = subset( data_combined, PassengerId > nrow(train) );
childIndices = which( newTrain$FixedAge < 15 );
womenOrChildren = union( femaleIndices, childIndices );
maleIndices = setdiff( 1:nrow(train), womenOrChildren );
womenOrChildrenSurvived = which( train[ womenOrChildren, "Survived"] == 1 );
menDied = which( train[ maleIndices, "Survived"] == 0);
numFemales = length( femaleIndices );
numMales = length( maleIndices );
trainProportionCorrect = ( length(womenOrChildrenSurvived) + length(menDied))/nrow(train);
```

In the training set, the proportion of correct predictions is 0.79.  

```{r womenAndChildrenFirstTest, echo=FALSE}
# start with all perished model, then set women and children to survived
womenAndChildrenFirstModel = data.frame(PassengerId=test$PassengerId, Survived=0);
femaleIndices = which( test$Sex == 'female' );
newTest = subset( data_combined, PassengerId > nrow(train) );
childIndices = which( newTest$FixedAge < 15 );
womenOrChildren = union( femaleIndices, childIndices );
womenAndChildrenFirstModel[womenOrChildren,"Survived"] = 1;
write.csv( womenAndChildrenFirstModel, "womenAndChildrenFirstModel.csv", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE );
```

Upon submission to Kaggle, the Women and Children First model scored 0.76076.

### Logistic Regression Model

A logistic regression model is fit using the train data.  Selected variables are shown below.  Some variables could be treated as either numeric or factors (i.e., NumPassengersOnTicket and NumChildren).  Because there was a natural ordering of these variables, they are treated as numeric values rather than factors.  This was done to capture the linear dependence of each variable to the survival response.

```{r logisticRegression1, echo=FALSE}
glm.fit = glm( Survived~pclass+Sex+FixedAge+FarePerPassenger+FixedTitle+CabinAssignment+Embarked+NumPassengersOnTicket+NumParents+NumChildren+as.factor(Spouses)+Siblings,data=newTrain,family=binomial);
summary( glm.fit );
trainSetProbs = predict( glm.fit, newTrain, type="response");  # now a vector of probabilities
# probabilities >= 0.5 mean survived, < 0.5 mean perished
threshold = 0.5;
predictions = as.numeric( trainSetProbs >= threshold );

# How'd we do?
# now calculate the training set error
correctRate = mean( predictions == newTrain$Survived );
# scored a 0.8338945

# now, how'd we do against the test set?
# first, need to change dona. to Lady.
newTest$FixedTitle = newTest$Title;
idxDona = which( newTest$FixedTitle == "Dona." );
newTest[idxDona,"FixedTitle"] = "Lady.";
testSetProbs = predict( glm.fit, newTest, type="response");
testPredictions = as.numeric( testSetProbs >= threshold );
fullLogisticRegressionModel = data.frame(PassengerId=test$PassengerId, Survived=testPredictions);

write.csv( fullLogisticRegressionModel, "FullLogisticRegressionModel.csv", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE );
# scored a 0.78947 - not what we expected
```

After fitting the model to the training data, the model was run on the training set yielding a training set test error of 0.1661055 (0.8338945 accuracy rate).  The first run of the model against the test set failed because the training set had no instances of any passengers with the title "Dona.", an Italian honorific.  The model must have at least one instance of each factor in the training set if the factors are present in the test set.  The closest title that is represented in the training set is "Lady." so the passenger with the "Dona." title was given the "Lady." title so the model would run.

```{r logisticRegression2, echo=FALSE}
cat( "Training Set performance:\n");
table( newTrain$Survived, predictions);
```

The model had an overall accuracy of 0.78947 on the test set (the score from Kaggle).  Since this was lower than the expected score (the training set yielded a score of 0.8338945), it appears the model may be slightly overfitting the training data.  To reduce the variance, the regularization methods of ridge regression and lasso are considered.

### Logistic Regression with Ridge Regression Regularization
Ridge regression introduces a coefficient penalty that reduces the effect of the covariates.  This can help with variance by making the solution slightly less flexible.  The glmnet package includes a method for determining the lambda penalty coefficient using cross validation (default is 10-fold cross validation).
```{r ridgeRegression, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library( glmnet );
lambdas = c();
set.seed(1);
# use ridge regression
xTrain = model.matrix( Survived~pclass+Sex+FixedAge+FarePerPassenger+FixedTitle+CabinAssignment+Embarked+NumPassengersOnTicket+NumParents+NumChildren+as.factor(Spouses)+Siblings,data=newTrain,family=binomial);
xTest = model.matrix( ~pclass+Sex+FixedAge+FarePerPassenger+FixedTitle+CabinAssignment+Embarked+NumPassengersOnTicket+NumParents+NumChildren+as.factor(Spouses)+Siblings,data=newTest,family=binomial);
cv.out = cv.glmnet( xTrain, newTrain$Survived, alpha=0);
plot( cv.out );
lambdaMin = cv.out$lambda.min;
cat( "lambda = ", lambdaMin );
rrmodel = glmnet( xTrain, newTrain$Survived, alpha=0);
ridge.pred = predict( rrmodel, s=lambdaMin, newx=xTest);
ridgePredictions = as.numeric( ridge.pred >= threshold );
ridgeRegressionModel = data.frame(PassengerId=test$PassengerId, Survived=ridgePredictions);
write.csv( ridgeRegressionModel, "RidgeRegressionModel.csv", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE );
# score is 0.78947
```

The training set mean squared error is the smallest at a lambda value of 0.06771608.  When comparing to the full logistic regression solution, the ridge predictions are the same as the least-squares logistic regression in 409 of the 418 cases (97.8% of the test set).  Despite differing on the survived prediction for 9 passengers, the ridge solution scored a 0.78947 upon submission to the Kaggle site - the same score as the full logistic regression solution.

```{r ridgeRegression2, echo=FALSE}
logisticPredictions = testPredictions;
table( testPredictions, ridgePredictions );
```

### Logistic Regression with Lasso Regularization
Similar to ridge regression, lasso regularization introduces a penalty to reduce the magnitude of coefficient estimates.  As with ridge regression, the glmnet implementation of the lasso uses cross validation to estimate the best value of lambda.

```{r lassoRegression, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# on to the lasso
xTrain = model.matrix( Survived~pclass+Sex+FixedAge+FarePerPassenger+FixedTitle+CabinAssignment+Embarked+NumPassengersOnTicket+NumParents+NumChildren+as.factor(Spouses)+Siblings,data=newTrain,family=binomial);
xTest = model.matrix( ~pclass+Sex+FixedAge+FarePerPassenger+FixedTitle+CabinAssignment+Embarked+NumPassengersOnTicket+NumParents+NumChildren+as.factor(Spouses)+Siblings,data=newTest,family=binomial);
cv.out = cv.glmnet( xTrain, newTrain$Survived, alpha=1);
plot( cv.out );
lambdaMin = cv.out$lambda.min;
cat( "lambda = ", lambdaMin);
lassomodel = glmnet( xTrain, newTrain$Survived, alpha=1);
lasso.pred = predict( lassomodel, s=lambdaMin, newx=xTest);
lassoPredictions = as.numeric( lasso.pred >= threshold );
lassoRegressionModel = data.frame(PassengerId=test$PassengerId, Survived=lassoPredictions);
write.csv( lassoRegressionModel, "LassoRegressionModel.csv", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE );
```

The lasso model performed very similarly to the ridge regression model, differing only in a single case.  Compared to the full least-squares logistic regression model, the lasso agreed with the logistic predictions in 408/418 cases (97.6%). 

```{r lassoRegression2, echo=FALSE}
table( logisticPredictions, lassoPredictions );
table( ridgePredictions, lassoPredictions );
# score is 0.78947
```

As was the case with the Logistic Regression and Ridge Regression models, the Lasso model scored a 0.78947 upon submission to the Kaggle site.  This, despite differing from the Logistic Regression predictions for 10 passengers.
